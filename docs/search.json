    "text": "What do you think being a data scientist is about?\nBeing a data scientist is about taking large amounts data and drawing meaningful and impactful insights, usually for business stakeholders to use to make informed decisions. The data could come in any form or structure and it is up to the data scientist to communicate and tell the story through the data. This will typically involve ingesting the data, cleaning the data, then interpreting, visualizing, and communicating the data.\n\n\nWhat differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nA data scientist typically deals with data on a large scale and majority of their role is getting the data into a form that can be easily interpreted and meaningful to the question or analysis at hand. A statistician would use a smaller data set that is usually already in usable form and they use this structured data to model and predict different scenarios.\n\n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nIn my current role I am somewhere in the middle. I believe having the knowledge of a data scientist and knowing how to work with large amounts of data is a very valuable skill that can then lead to powerful modeling and analysis work as a statistician.\n\n\nPractice R Code Using the Iris Dataset!\nThe data set we are working with is the density of the iris sepal length. In the following R code we are going to store this data set as the variable y.\n\ny &lt;- density(iris$Sepal.Length)\n\nNow that we have this stored as y, we can refer to it as such in the following code. Using the class(), typeof(), and str() functions, we can determine the class of the this data set, type of internal storage it is made of, and the structure of it.\n\nclass(y); typeof(y); str(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] 3.48 3.49 3.5 3.51 3.52 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00023 0.000259 0.000293 0.000329 0.00037 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.274\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Sepal.Length)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Sepal.Length\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\nWe can see that the class of this data set is density and it is in the form of a list. The structure is a list of 8, with the x variable/axis being the iris sepal length and the y variable/axis being the density. Both x and y have 1 dimension with 512 items."
